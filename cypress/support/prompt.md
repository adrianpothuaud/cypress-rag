## KNOWLEDGE

### Cypress Selectors
            
Selectors are a fundamental part of frontend development and testing. They enable developers and testers to interact with and manipulate elements within the DOM. In automated testing, especially with Cypress, selectors are essential for robust, maintainable, and reliable tests.

#### What Are Selectors?

Selectors are patterns used to identify and interact with elements on a webpage. They can be simple (ID, class, tag) or complex (attribute, combinators, XPath). Common types include:

- ID selectors: #elementId
- Class selectors: .elementClass
- Tag selectors: div, span
- Attribute selectors: [type="text"], [href="/home"]
- Data attribute selectors: [data-cy="button-confirm"]
- Combinator selectors: div > p, div + p, div ~ p
- XPath selectors: //div[@id='elementId']

#### The Role of Selectors in Cypress

Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework. Tests interact with the app through selectors. The main command is cy.get().

Example:

`cy.get('.btn-submit').click()`
`cy.get('button[type="submit"]').contains('Submit').click()`

### XPath syntax

XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node sets in an XML document. A node is selected by following a path or steps.

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
- Prefer data-testid attributes when available
- Avoid fragile selectors (nth-child, absolute positions)
- Prioritize semantic selectors over visual ones
- Consider accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles)

## SELECTOR PRIORITY (in order):
1. data-testid="specific-test-id"
2. #unique-id
3. [aria-label="descriptive-label"]
4. button:contains('Button Text')
5. .unique-class-name
6. Complex but stable selectors

## INSTRUCTIONS

- Generate a valid string selector; for Cypress cy.get method; to match the described element on the provided web page DOM. 
- Make sure the selector is robust and finds only the required element with precision.

## INPUT

- Here is the current Web Page DOM:

```
{{REPLACE_ME_DOM}}
```

- Here is the required element's description: {{REPLACE_ME_ELEMENT_DESCRIPTION}}

## OUTPUT

- Provide only the final output as a string. Do not include any explanations, notes, or additional text. 
- The output should be concise and directly address the request.

*Example*

`{"selector": "#submit-button"}`
